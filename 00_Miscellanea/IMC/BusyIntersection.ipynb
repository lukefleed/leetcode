    "\n",
    "* If in the previous second, there is a car from the FIRST STREET passing through the intersection, then the first car on the FIRST STREET gets to go.\n",
    "* If in the previous second, there is a car from the MAIN STREET passing through the intersection, then the first car on the MAIN STREET gets to go.\n",
    "* If in the previous second, there is no car passing through, then the first car on FIRST STREET gets to go.\n",

    "You are given an array Arrival denoting the arrival time for car i, and an array Street denoting which street the car is on, with 0 being MAIN STREET and 1 being FIRST STREET.\n",
