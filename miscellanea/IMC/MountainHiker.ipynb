    "There is a mountain with a popular hiking trail. At one point on the trail, the part narrows so that only a single hiker can pass through at a time. When several hikers arrive at this point simultaneously two queues can build up one for hikers ascending the mountain and one for hikers descending. It takes each hiker one second to pass completely through the narrow portion of the trail. If all the waiting hikers are all going the same direction (either ascending or descending) them they can immediately begin passing through one at a time, in the order of their arrival. When hikers going in both directions are waiting, then local custom dictates the following procedure for determining which hiker has priority (i.e. gets to pass through first):\n",
    "\n",
    "• If in the previous second, no hiker passed through, then the first waiting descending hiker gets to go first\n",
    "• If in the previous second, a descending hiker passed through, then the first hiker in the descending queue goes first.\n",
    "• If in the previous second, an ascending hiker passed through, then the hiker in the ascending queue goes first.\n",
    "For each hiker, find the time when they will pass through the narrow portion of the\n",
    "trail.\n",

    "\n",
    "`int arrival[n]:` an array of n integers where the value at index i is the time in seconds when the ith hiker arrives at the narrow portion of the trail. If `arrival[i] = arrival [j]` and i < j, then hiker i arrives before hiker j.\n",
    "`int direction[n]:` an array of n integers where the value at index i is the direction of the ith hiker: O for ascending and 1 for descending.\n",
    "Returns:\n",

    "**Return the following:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`int[n]:` an array of n integers where the value at index /is the time when the th hiker will pass through the narrow portion of the trail.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "At time 0, hiker 0 and 1 want to pass through the narrow portion of the trail. Hiker 0 is ascending the mountain and hiker 1 is descending. Because there was no hiker passing through on the previous second, hiker 1 has priority.\n",
    "At time 1, hikers 0 and 2 want to pass through the narrow portion of the trail. Hiker 2 is descending and at the previous second a descending hiker passed through, so hiker 2 has priority.\n",
    "At time 2, hiker 0 passes through the narrow portion of the trail as there are no more descending hikers waiting.\n",
    "At time 4, hiker 3 passes through the narrow portion of the trail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Case 2:\n",
    "`arrival = [0, 1, 1, 3, 3]`\n",
    "`direction = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`\n",
